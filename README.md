# Interrupts-Lab

Interrupts are utilized to improve efficiency and responsiveness, replacing polling methods for tasks such as driving the 7-segment displays, scanning the keypad, and generating sound via the PC speaker. Key tasks include updating the Keypad and Segment Display modules and implementing a new Siren Module, with timer interrupts managing delays, display refreshing, key scanning, and waveform generation. This lab demonstrates how interrupts eliminate display flicker and improve system performance, providing practical experience with real-time embedded system design.
