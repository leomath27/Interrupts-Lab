siren module

stuff now uses the interupts for the timer

updating the keypad and segment display stuff as well as the siren
check out the delay module to see how to design modules that use timer
interrupts

delay module now requires an initDelay call

delayms works the same

look back at the delay module to see how delays are implemented

TIOS: Timer Input Capture/Output Compare Select
Register
sets bit 5 for pin 5

TIE: timer interrupt enable bitmask for each pin

TCTL(1/2): this configures the output acction when comparison is hit

TC(0,...,7): output compare registers

TSCR(1,2): timer system control registers

TSCR important bits 7 and 4
bit 7 enables the timer (can turn it off for lower power consumption)
bit 4 timer fast flag clear all

TSCR sets the prescalar

42 for checklist
